It utilizes the k-means clustering algorithm, which is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for grouping similar data points.\n\nThe project starts by collecting data from a list of microprocessors, including their price and frequency (in GHz). The dataset serves as the basis for training the k-means model. The algorithm groups the microprocessors into clusters based on their frequency, aiming to identify patterns and similarities among them.\n\nBy analyzing the clustered data, the project aims to uncover relationships between the frequency and price of microprocessors. This information can then be used to create a model that can estimate the price of a microprocessor based on its frequency. The model learns from the patterns observed in the training data and applies them to make predictions for new, unseen microprocessors.","title":"k-means for Microprocessors","image":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAALCAIAAADwazoUAAAACXBIWXMAABJ0AAASdAHeZh94AAAAsElEQVR42pWSyQ7DMAhE8///mk0NDssAFXYU9dKD5zBCtp5Yl4ggIhF7BYCZ13Xdtm3f963rOE5VtR+p6uLuzHrfOauIKNisYPd5GEAvIUXm4dGIe7Y2D59nTSKzYGASjghVy0zVnBpbwWYmvd2IJKrOI2Yym9n7pFr1M1cApNnfLYzMdRLeBSCiHPDW0JoTeWt+Xf75YDjRExPhyTyuR1WG1/pM6wJMxidzuciIZfgX3EqLUWa/pRkAAAAASUVORK5CYII="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/6da6422101d8c6cf77fff62704b136ac/c54ab/4_e68279b6b6.png","srcSet":"/static/6da6422101d8c6cf77fff62704b136ac/3e6c0/4_e68279b6b6.png 283w,\n/static/6da6422101d8c6cf77fff62704b136ac/c4242/4_e68279b6b6.png 566w,\n/static/6da6422101d8c6cf77fff62704b136ac/c54ab/4_e68279b6b6.png 1131w","sizes":"(min-width: 1131px) 1131px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/6da6422101d8c6cf77fff62704b136ac/aa116/4_e68279b6b6.webp 283w,\n/static/6da6422101d8c6cf77fff62704b136ac/512ef/4_e68279b6b6.webp 566w,\n/static/6da6422101d8c6cf77fff62704b136ac/5ce93/4_e68279b6b6.webp 1131w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1131px) 1131px, 100vw"}]},"width":1131,"height":601}}}}}},"pageContext":{"id":"f0b4562d-aec0-52b4-8430-49f3bbeb613e","title":"k-means for Microprocessors","__params":{"title":"k-means-for-microprocessors"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["407915407","4202924991"],"slicesMap":{}}
